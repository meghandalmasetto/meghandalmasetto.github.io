    <h1>THE WAR OF THE WORLDS<br></h1>
    <h2>COLUMBIA BROADCASTING SYSTEM ORSON WELLES AND MERCURY THEATRE ON THE AIR SUNDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1938 8:00 TO 9:00 P.M.</h2>
    <p>PIERSON: As I set down these notes on paper, I'm obsessed by the thought that I may be the last living man on earth. I have been hiding in this empty house near Grovers Mill -- a small island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world. All that happened before the arrival of these monstrous creatures in the world now seems part of another life. . . a life that has no continuity with the present, furtive existence of the lonely derelict who pencils these words on the back of some astronomical notes bearing the signature of Richard Pierson. I look down at my blackened hands, my torn shoes, my tattered clothes, and I try to connect them with a professor who lives at Princeton, and who on the night of October 30, glimpsed through his telescope an orange splash of light on a distant planet. My wife, my colleagues, my students, my books, my observatory, my. . . my world. . . where are they? Did they ever exist? Am I Richard Pierson? What day is it? Do days exist without calendars? Does time pass when there are no human hands left to wind the clocks? . . .In writing down my daily life I tell myself shall preserve human history between the dark covers of this little book that was meant to record the movements of the stars. . . But to write I must live, and to live, I must eat . . . I find moldy bread in the kitchen, and an orange not too spoiled to swallow. I keep watch at the window. From time to time I catch sight of a Martian above the black smoke. The smoke still holds the house in its black coil. . . but at length there is a hissing sound and suddenly I see a Martian mounted on his machine, spraying the air with a jet of steam, as if to dissipate the smoke. I watch in a corner as his huge metal legs nearly brush against the house. Exhausted by terror, I fall asleep. . .it's morning. . . (QUIETLY) Morning! Sun streams in the window. The black cloud of gas has lifted, and the scorched meadows to the north look as though a black snowstorm has passed over them. I venture from the house. I make my way to a road. No traffic. Here and there a wrecked car, baggage overturned, a blackened skeleton. I push on north. For some reason I feel safer trailing these monsters than running away from them. And I keep a careful watch. I have seen the Martians. . . feed. Should one of their machines appear over the top of trees, I am ready to fling myself flat on the earth. I come to a chestnut tree. October chestnuts are ripe. I fill my pockets. I must keep alive. Two days I wander in a vague northerly direction through a desolate world. Finally I notice a living creature. . . a small red squirrel in a beech tree. I stare at him, and wonder. He stares back at me. I believe at that moment the animal and I shared the same emotion. . .the joy of finding another living being. I push on north. I find dead cows in a brackish field. Beyond, the charred ruins of a dairy. The silo remains standing guard over the waste land like a lighthouse deserted by the sea. Astride the silo perches a weathercock. The arrow points north. Next day I came to a city vaguely familiar in its contours, yet its buildings strangely dwarfed and leveled off, as if a giant hand sliced off its highest towers with a capricious sweep of his hand. I reached the outskirts. I found Newark, undemolished, but humbled by some whim of the advancing Martians. Presently, with an odd feeling of being watched, I caught sight of something crouching in a doorway. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and became a man! -- a man, armed with a large knife. <br> 
    STRANGER: (OFF MIKE) Stop. . . (CLOSER) where did you come from? <br> 
    PIERSON: I come from . . . many places. A long time ago from Princeton. <br> 
    STRANGER: Princeton, huh? That's near Grovers Mill! <br>
    PIERSON: Yes. <br>
    STRANGER: Grovers Mill. . . (LAUGHS AS AT A GREAT JOKE) There's no food here. This is my country. . . all this end of town down to the river. There's only food for one. . . Which way are you going? <br>
    PIERSON: I don't know. I guess I'm looking for -- for people. <br>
    STRANGER: (NERVOUSLY) What was that? Did you hear something just then? <br>
    PIERSON: Only a bird . . . (AMAZED) A live bird! <br>
    STRANGER: You get to know that birds have shadows these days. . . Say, we're in the open here. Let's crawl into this doorway and talk. <br>
    PIERSON: Have you seen any . . . Martians? <br>
    STRANGER: Naah. They've gone over to New York. At night the sky is alive with their lights. Just as if people were still livin' in it. By daylight you can't see them. Five days ago a couple of them carried somethin' big across the flats from the airport. I believe they're learning how to fly. <br>
    PIERSON: Fly! <br>
    STRANGER: Yeah, fly. <br>
    PIERSON: Then it's all over with humanity. Stranger, there's still you and I. Two of us left. <br>
    STRANGER: They got themselves in solid; they wrecked the greatest country in the world. Those green stars, they're probably falling somewhere every night. They've only lost one machine. There isn't anything to do. We're done. We're licked. <br>
    PIERSON: Where were you? You're in a uniform. <br>
    STRANGER: Yeah, what's left of it. I was in the militia -- national guard. . . That's good! Wasn't any war any more than there's war between men and ants. <br>
    PIERSON: And we're eat-able ants. I found that out. . . What will they do with us? <br>
    STRANGER: I've thought it all out. Right now we're caught as we're wanted. The Martian only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run. But they won't keep doing that. They'll begin catching us systematic-like -- keeping the best and storing us in cages and things. They haven't begun on us yet! <br>
    PIERSON: Not begun! <br>
    STRANGER: Not begun! All that's happened so far is because we don't have sense enough to keep quiet. . . botherin' them with guns and such stuff and losing our heads and rushing off in crowds. Now instead of our rushing around blind we've got to fix ourselves up -- fix ourselves up according to the way things are NOW. Cities, nations, civilization, progress. . . done. <br>
    PIERSON: But if that's so, what is there to live for? <br>
    STRANGER: Well, there won't be any more concerts for a million years or so, and no nice little dinners at restaurants. If it's amusement you're after, I guess the game's up. <br>
    PIERSON: And what is there left? <br>
    STRANGER: Life. . . that's what! I want to live. Yeah, and so do you. We're not going to be exterminated. And I don't mean to be caught, either, and tamed, and fattened, and bred, like an ox. <br>
    PIERSON: What are you going to do? <br>
    STRANGER: I'm going on. . . right under their feet. I got a plan. We men as men are finished. We don't know enough. We gotta learn plenty before we've got a chance. And we've got to live and keep free while we learn, see? I've thought it all out, see. <br>
    PIERSON: Tell me the rest. <br>
    STRANGER: Well, it isn't all of us that were made for wild beasts, and that's what it's got to be. That's why I watched YOU. All these little office workers that used to live in these houses -- they'd be no good. They haven't any stuff to 'em. They just used to run off to work. I've seen hundreds of 'em, running wild to catch their commuter train in the morning for fear they'd get canned if they didn't; running back at night afraid they won't be in time for dinner. Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents. And on Sundays, worried about the hereafter. The Martians will be a godsend for those guys. Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, no worries. After a week or so chasing about the fields on empty stomachs they'll come and be glad to be caught. <br>
    PIERSON: You've thought it all out, haven't you? <br>
    STRANGER: You bet I have! And that isn't all. These Martians will make pets of some of 'em, train 'em to do tricks. Who knows? Get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed. . . And some, maybe, they'll train to hunt us. 
    PIERSON: No, that's impossible. No human being. . . <br>
    STRANGER: Yes they will. There's men who'll do it gladly. If one of them ever comes after me, why. . . <br>
    PIERSON: In the meantime, you and I and others like us. . . where are we to live when the Martians own the earth? <br>
    STRANGER: I've got it all figured out. We'll live underground. I've been thinking about the sewers. Under New York are miles and miles of 'em. The main ones are big enough for anybody. Then there's cellars, vaults, underground storerooms, railway tunnels, subways. You begin to see, eh? And we'll get a bunch of strong men together. No weak ones; that rubbish -- out. <br>
    PIERSON: And you meant me to go? <br>
    STRANGER: Well, I gave you a chance, didn't I? <br>
    PIERSON: We won't quarrel about that. Go on. <br>
    STRANGER: And we've got to make safe places for us to stay in, see, and get all the books we can -- science books. That's where men like you come in, see? We'll raid the museums, we'll even spy on the Martians. It may not be so much we have to learn before -- just imagine this: four or five of their own fighting machines suddenly start off -- heat rays right and left and not a Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em! But MEN -- men who have learned the way how. It may even be in our time. Gee! Imagine having one of them lovely things with its heat ray wide and free! We'd turn it on Martians, we'd turn it on men. We'd bring everybody down to their knees. <br>
    PIERSON: That's your plan? <br>
    STRANGER: You, and me, and a few more of us we'd own the world. <br>
    PIERSON: I see. . . <br>
    STRANGER: (FADING OUT) Say, what's the matter? . . . Where are you going? <br>
    PIERSON: Not to your world. . . Goodbye, stranger. . . <br>
    PIERSON: After parting with the artilleryman, I came at last to the Holland Tunnel. I entered that silent tube anxious to know the fate of the great city on the other side of the Hudson. Cautiously I came out of the tunnel and made my way up Canal Street. I reached Fourteenth Street, and there again were black powder and several bodies, and an evil ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses. I wandered up through the Thirties and Forties; I stood alone on Times Square. I caught sight of a lean dog running down Seventh Avenue with a piece of dark brown meat in his jaws, and a pack of starving mongrels at his heels. He made a wide circle around me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh competitor. I walked up Broadway in the direction of that strange powder -- past silent shopwindows, displaying their mute wares to empty sidewalks -- past the Capitol Theatre, silent, dark -- past a shooting gallery, where a row of empty guns faced an arrested line of wooden ducks. Near Columbus Circle I noticed models of 1939 motorcars in the showrooms facing empty streets. From over the top of the General Motors Building, I watched a flock of black birds circling in the sky. I hurried on. Suddenly I caught sight of the hood of a Martian machine, standing somewhere in Central Park, gleaming in the late afternoon sun. An insane idea! I rushed recklessly across Columbus Circle and into the Park. I climbed a small hill above the pond at Sixtieth Street. From there I could see, standing in a silent row along the mall, nineteen of those great metal Titans, their cowls empty, their great steel arms hanging listlessly by their sides. I looked in vain for the monsters that inhabit those machines. Suddenly, my eyes were attracted to the immense flock of black birds that hovered directly below me. They circled to the ground, and there before my eyes, stark and silent, lay the Martians, with the hungry birds pecking and tearing brown shreds of flesh from their dead bodies. Later when their bodies were examined in the laboratories, it was found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared. . . slain, after all man's defenses had failed, by the humblest thing that God in His wisdom put upon this earth. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seedbed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a remote dream. It may be that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, is the future ordained perhaps. Strange it now seems to sit in my peaceful study at Princeton writing down this last chapter of the record begun at a deserted farm in Grovers Mill. Strange to see from my window the university spires dim and blue through an April haze. Strange to watch children playing in the streets. Strange to see young people strolling on the green, where the new spring grass heals the last black scars of a bruised earth. Strange to watch the sightseers enter the museum where the dissembled parts of a Martian machine are kept on public view. Strange when I recall the time when I first saw it, bright and clean-cut, hard, and silent, under the dawn of that last great day. <br>

Starting now, we couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night. . . so we did the best next thing.

You will be relieved, I hope, to learn that we didn't mean it, and that both institutions are still open for business. So goodbye everybody, and remember the terrible lesson you learned tonight.

    <h1>THE MARTIAN FILM & SCIENCE</h1>
    <h2>'The Martian' Might Be the Most Realistic Space Movie Ever Made
    <br>By Calla Cofield October 15, 2015</h2>
    <p>
    
    "The Martian," a science fiction film based on the novel by Andy Weir, might be the most realistic space exploration movie ever made. <br>
    The film adaptation of Andy Weir's breakout novel "The Martian" isn't just awesome, it might also be one of the most realistic space exploration movies that's ever graced the silver screen. <br>
    Whenever a new science fiction movie comes out, there's often a lot of talk about how "accurate" it is, and this is usually in reference to the science: Can dinosaur DNA really come from a preserved mosquito? Can an asteroid really be deflected with a nuclear bomb? There's even an organization called the Science and Entertainment Exchange in Los Angeles that connects science-fiction writers with real scientists to consult on their work. <br>
    But a science-fiction film's "accuracy" or "realism" shouldn't hinge only on the science and technology, but also on the presentation of scientists and their culture. With that in mind, "The Martian" might be the most realistic (but fictional) space movie of all time. Like Andy Weir's book of the same name, the movie captures the culture of science — the way scientists talk, the way they interact, their motivations and their response to extreme failure. And the fact that a lot of them are real smart asses. (The movie may have actually have been too realistic, judging by the number of people who wondered if it was based on a true story.) <br>
    A scientist — as portrayed in most big-budget movies — usually resembles a robot more than a human. These caricatures of scientists show them as dorky, calculating, anti-social, almost never cool or confident, and rarely funny (and if they are, they usually crack jokes about "Star Wars.") <br>
    Mark Watney, the lead character in "The Martian," is an antidote to that tired trope. He's funny, and his humor may be what saves him from losing hope — and his mental stability — when he gets stranded alone on Mars. And Watney isn't alone — many of the scientists and engineers in the movie (and even more of them in the book) match him in wits and humor. 
    The other scientists and engineers in the movie also run counter to the typical "scientist" stereotype. Commander Lewis, played by Jessica Chastain, is a no-nonsense, Navy-trained geologist leading a human mission to Mars, who also loves disco and TV shows from the 1970s. It'd be tough to break the stereotype of a scientist much more than that. To be fair, the movie does feature one strange, somewhat robotlike scientist, Rich Purnell, but that character feels more real (not just excusable) because he is an exception, not the rule. <br>
    Drew Goddard, who wrote the screenplay for "The Martian," grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico — a town that was literally built around a national science laboratory and is populated "entirely [by] rocket scientists," according to Goddard. At a panel discussion following a screening of the movie in New York, Goddard spoke about how the book captured the reality of the scientific culture that he recognized from his upbringing. <br>
    "Andy [Weir] really captured in his book the way scientists sound," Goddard said. "It wasn't just about the technical stuff being right. I don't want to say it's the 'easy part,' but we can look that stuff up. The tricky part is getting the way [scientists] talk, and that is usually what I find that Hollywood films get wrong." <br>
    Compared to scientists depicted in most movies, Goddard says he remembers scientists being "much funnier." He continued by saying, "And there's this collegial atmosphere that happens when smart people are trying to work together. And that's what the book captured and it was important to me to protect that, Goddard said. "To me, it was all about protecting that soul, that soul of scientists working together to solve a problem and not knowing how to solve a problem but trusting their instincts on what to do." – Matt Damon <br>
    It takes a lot of people to pull off a trip to space <br>
    Who knew the construction schedules for space probes could be so fascinating? Of course, it adds quite a bit of drama when those schedules determine whether an astronaut lives or dies, as is the case in "The Martian." <br>
    In so much of futuristic science fiction, spaceflight is almost taken for granted: People hop into rockets and start them up with the ease of turning on a car engine. Getting into and out of a spacesuit takes a matter of seconds. In modern-day spaceflight, these things require hours, days, weeks of preparation, no matter how many times they've been done before. And that means there are dozens or hundreds of engineers, project leaders and other staffers who are all essential for getting probes into space — not to mention astronauts. <br>
    While Mark Watney is without a doubt the star of the movie, it's impressive how much credit "The Martian" gives to the people who are supporting him. It lays out the struggles of the people trying to build a probe to send food to Watney, and the many, many things that can go wrong during a rocket launch. (Movies like "Apollo 13" are notable because they demonstrate the importance of the people on the ground.) <br>
    This also makes for a delightful couple of Easter eggs for fans of real-world spaceflight and space-related science. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is practically a character all on its own (even though the lab shown in the movie is not actually the JPL campus). <br>
    Space is dangerous, even without a freak accident <br>
    There are many, many, many movie plots that revolve around something terrible happening in space. An asteroid is headed toward Earth, the core of the Earth stops spinning, the sun starts radiating too many particles, there's another asteroid behind the first one, there's deadly space debris, there's a monster that lives on the moon, there's a monster that lives on Mars, there's a monster that lives on an old spaceship, people live in space too long and they turn into monsters, oh, and there's another asteroid. <br>
    "The Martian" begins with an extraordinary circumstance: An astronaut is mistaken for dead, and is left behind on Mars. But beyond that, the only obstacles that Watney faces are the normal, ever-present challenges of living on the Red Planet — things like maintaining a habitat when the surface has almost no atmosphere, or growing plants where there is no water, no soil microbes and extreme temperature fluctuations. In other words, it's a survival story in space that doesn't need asteroids or monsters or any of that stuff, because space is a hard enough place in which to survive as it is. <br>[How Director Ridley Scott Made 'The Martian' (Exclusive Interview ) ] <br>
    Many filmmakers would probably worry that a story without the crazy disasters (just the "normal" stuff) would be boring for an audience. Huge applause should go to the creators of "The Martian" for recognizing just how untrue that is. The story is well-told, the audience cares about Watney and watching someone try to live on Mars is freaking awesome. (Leroy Chiao, he AstroCritic,, weighed in on what else the movie got right about astronauts.) <br>
    By using real obstacles as Watney's enemy, the movie is also able to not only stick to real science, but also to make it extremely fascinating (once again, boring science problems become interesting when they are part of a great story). Major struggles arise because of how cold Mars is, and because it has a different atmospheric pressure than Earth (and Watney's artificial habitat). NASA struggles to communicate with Watney and send him supplies because Earth and Mars are really, really, really far away from each other. Overcoming these types of problems are what Weir says got him started writing the book, and the movie maintains the science extremely well.

    Space is not the enemy <br>
    With so many space movies centered on a terrible catastrophe, it's no wonder that most movie astronauts often end up seriously regretting ever leaving Earth. These films also leave audiences with the feeling that space itself is a kind of monster that should inspire nothing but fear. (The 2013 movie "Gravity" literally used a disaster in space as a metaphor for a dead child, and the struggle to get back to Earth as the emotional recovery from that trauma.) <br>
    This fear, or even hatred, of space might be the single biggest inaccuracy in most space-related movies. <br>
    The history of spaceflight contains fatalities, some of which arose out of horrible, preventable circumstances. While these events initiate action, reflection and mourning, they have never made people stop wanting to explore space. <br>
    "The Martian" captures this extremely well. Even when NASA thinks Watney is dead, it continues to push into the unknown. People keep thinking about the next human trip to Mars. There is an acknowledgement that despite every effort to keep astronauts alive, spaceflight and space exploration carry with them the risk of death, and astronauts willingly accept that. <br>
    Even when Watney finds himself at one of his lowest points, when he's drafting a letter to his parents knowing that they may very well outlive him, he tells them, "I love what I do." <br>
    It's fantastic to see a movie finally capture that attitude. That passion is hardwired into enough people that humanity is now making serious plans to land people on another planet. Nature will trip up those hard and again, but that's an expected part of the journey.

    <h1>MISSION TO MARS VS. RED PLANET - FILM REVIEW</h1>
    <h2>Seeing Double: ‘Mission to Mars’ vs ‘Red Planet,’ 2000’s Competing Sci-Fi Adventures <br><br> By Rob Hunter</h2>
    <p>
      Mission to Mars opens in 2020 during a celebration for an impending mission to Mars that hopes to confirm the planet as a possible new home for humanity. NASA is sending a team of astronauts into space, and thirteen months later they’re roaming the planet’s surface in search of a possible water source when they find something strange. A sand storm swirls around a mountain and begins picking apart the team – quite literally in one poor shlub’s case – before revealing a newly exposed alien face carved out of the earth. (The mars? How does this work exactly?) <br><br>
      Anyway, mission control back home receives a disturbing message from the doomed team’s commander. Realizing he’s still alive, NASA puts together a rescue mission, but things go awry before they even reach the planet. Tiny meteors, explosions, and a twenty-minute spacewalk sequence meant to be suspenseful but hampered by flat dialogue audio seemingly pulled from rehearsal see the rescue team decimated. The survivors finally reach the planet’s surface – we know this because someone back on Earth says “They did it!” – where they find a frazzled commander barely hanging on. A quick round of DNA Sudoku later and the giant face opens as if to welcome them. Sounds impossible, I know, but as one of them says “We’re millions of miles from Earth inside a giant white face. What’s impossible?” Turns out the face on Mars is an alien hangar, and one of our heroes is about to get a journey beyond the stars. <br><br>
      Red Planet sends astronauts to Mars on an even more desperate mission as the Earth is severely overpopulated by 2025. Humanity has been sending probes to the planet depositing algae on its surface in an effort to build an atmosphere, but now the oxygen levels are dropping and they don’t know why. The team – a female commander and a male crew including an engineer, a biologist, a philosopher, and a killer robot – heads to Mars in search of answers. Solar flares mess up their day, though, leaving the commander trapped on the orbiting ship while the others crash land on the surface and enter into a deadly game of survival. One is killed in the crash, another is “accidentally” knocked off a cliff, a third is torn apart by the robot, a fourth is eaten by bugs, and the fifth is left to shake his head and summarize the film’s theme with “Fuck this planet.” <br><br>
      Both films are similar in their initial setup as astronauts head to Mars in the hope of finding it suitable for human development, but they diverge dramatically in what they do once there. If the best Mars-centric genre effort is The Martian Chronicles (1980) and the worst is Ghosts of Mars (2001) then these two sit somewhere in between… but closer to the latter. Mission to Mars delivers a little bit of wonder and cheese in its rough mashup of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and The Abyss (1989), but in addition to being too little too late, its execution also leaves viewers unmoved by its denouement. Still, the film finds value in Mars itself which is enough to make its story the winner between the two. Red Planet can’t claim the same as some oxygen-farting bugs aside these astronauts may as well be fighting to survive in any of Earth’s deserts. The planet’s alien landscape and environment are barely a consideration which is disappointing. So Mission to Mars takes this one. <br><br>
