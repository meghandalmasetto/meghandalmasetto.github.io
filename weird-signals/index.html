    <h1>End of Watch</h1>
    <h2>Elizabeth Lopatto</h2>
    <h3>January 24th, 2018</h3>
    <p>
      Here’s how to cheat at the Apple Watch Stand goal: dangle your wrist by your side while you sit in a chair. I discovered this by accident — I dangle my arm during meetings — but once I found it out, I did it on purpose. I cheated while watching Thor: Ragnarok, in meetings, at brunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheating the calorie-based Move goal is harder, but doing restorative yoga while also turning the “yoga” setting on did the trick. I wasn’t doing the hard work I do during my Ashtanga classes, but it still “counted” as exercise, as far as the Watch was concerned. (Restorative yoga is mainly very nice stretching. There are pillows.) The idea of failing at my goal was so abhorrent, I’d devised ways to cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      So yes, I’d say the Apple Watch changed my behavior. I just don’t know if Apple intended for it to happen this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are in the US, as I am, you are probably aware of the ongoing obesity crisis. Here’s the overview: as of the most recent report in 2014, 70 percent of American adults aged 20 and over are either overweight or obese. That includes me; I have a body mass index of 26, which puts me in the overweight category.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will doubtlessly be the point where some well-meaning reader emails me to tell me that muscles weigh more than fat, that people like LeBron James also qualify as “overweight,” and that BMI is a limited tool. This is true. It is also true that while I was recuperating from a bike crash, I gained enough weight that I went up a pants size. (It is fine; I have new pants.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LeBron James might qualify as overweight because of sheer muscular bulk, but I do not. Generally, if you are overweight, your doctor will suggest you exercise more and eat less. They might put it in fancier terms, but it’s what they mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years between 1980 and 2000, the number of Americans who were overweight and obese skyrocketed. There’s a complex set of explanations for that, which essentially boil down to physical inactivity, empty calories and aggressive marketing, and (maybe) constantly shifting explanations of what eating well means. There have always been people who have insisted that simply exercising more could solve the problem. There’s good data suggesting that’s not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But exercise has plenty of benefits. At least 150 minutes of exercise weekly — that’s two hours and 30 minutes, or slightly more than 20 minutes a day — can help reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Physical activity can help reduce the risk of diabetes and some cancers, too. Working out doesn’t just strengthen your muscles, it strengthens your bones, and your ability to balance, which are things that become crucial with age. Exercise can reduce the risk of depression, help you sleep better, and even increase your chances of a long life. Seriously, it’s good for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, only about half of American adults were meeting the recommended physical activity standards as of 2016, the CDC has found. We created our sedentary lifestyles with technology: cars, robots, computers, and appliances all made our lives easier, and TV meant our leisure hours were often spent sitting down. For the technologically inclined, it’s tempting to believe that our problems can also be solved with technology, which is how activity trackers came to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitness trackers aren’t as revolutionary as their makers advertise them to be: food journaling and calorie counting go back decades. But fitness trackers and the quantified self-movement have breathed new life into these old practices. Ben Franklin practiced an early form of activity tracking. In his autobiography, he writes about his “Plan for Attaining Moral Perfection,” which involved tracking the days he committed faults against virtues like temperance, frugality, and chastity. (Yes, Ben Franklin kept a bullet journal.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Franklin kept track of when he screwed up, which was a mistake. It’s better to note your successes. A gold star is a minor reward, but it is a reward. Rewards, as influential American psychologist B. F. Skinner noted, are highly motivating. Rewarding a behavior is a very easy way to reinforce that behavior. Humans really like gold stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s been a movement in health to try to modify behavior with movement trackers that reward behavior. Health insurers are especially interested in this idea: in March 2016, workers at UnitedHealthcare were eligible to win up to $1,460 if they met fitness goals as measured by Fitbit trackers. That program seems to be working, says Paul Sterling, the vice president of emerging products at UnitedHealthcare. The “engagement and activity rates that we’ve seen are very impressive,” he told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      UnitedHealthcare isn’t alone. Blue Shield of California gives some plan customers incentives for hitting their wearable goals. (Blue Shield didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, both through email and over the phone.) Starting with its September 2016 fall enrollment, Aetna subsidized Apple Watches; for 2018, it’s going to both subsidize the Watch again. Aetna has also partnered with Apple to develop proprietary apps. (When I contacted Aetna for comment, the company referred me to this press release from September.) The companies’ interest in behavioral health interventions make sense — to influence health factors that prevent disease, you need to change behavior.
      <br>You need gold stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing behavior around eating better and being more active is hard, and in general, people fail at it. But there’s a whole science of how to change your behavior to succeed, and it pretty much all goes back to one guy: Burrhus Frederic Skinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skinner’s big idea was basically this: you’ll do what you’re rewarded for. It doesn’t really matter if you’re a person, a cat, a pigeon, or a rat — rewards are a key part of animal behavior. The reward could be anything: a treat, some money, or just closing the rings on your Apple Watch. Skinner worked with rats and pigeons with the goal of improving the lives of his favorite animals, humans. Behaviorism is essentially a theory of how we acquire habits, the science behind why rewarding a child for writing makes a writer out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Essentially what Skinner said was that there are behavioral principles that are going on, and like gravity, whether you recognize them or not, they are operating on you,” says Julie Vargas, the president of the B. F. Skinner Foundation and also Skinner’s own daughter. “If you understand how things work at influencing what you do, then you can arrange those things in a way where you’ll get yourself to do what you want to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re obviously living in Skinner’s world. It’s casinos and the lottery, and the variable reinforcement that first made email and then social media so sticky. It’s also the signs on regular doors that request you use the revolving door instead, the ones that ban smoking indoors so that it would be easier for smokers to quit. The Weight Watchers and Lose It, or the cult of Nudge. And it’s the acute interest from insurers in wearables including the Apple Watch, and monetized reward systems tied to the goal of changing behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s often overlooked about Skinner’s work is that encouraging a healthy diet and regular exercise were among his areas of interest. In Walden Two, his painfully mediocre novel about a post-World War II commune living on behaviorist principles, commune members are meant to engage in routine outdoor chores in order to encourage them to exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skinner extended his ideas from Walden Two to the 1971 nonfiction book Beyond Freedom and Dignity where he famously denied the existence of free will. Behavior modification, he argues, is morally neutral and should be used for the betterment of society. The book infuriated both Noam Chomsky, the MIT linguist, and Ayn Rand, the objectivist author. It was the end of Skinner’s reputation. By 1975, Benjamin Spock, the media’s favorite pediatrician, wrote a letter saying he hadn’t bothered to read Skinner because his work was “fascist and manipulative,” according to The Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this, of course, was before Facebook and the Like button. Positive reinforcement is the engine that drives so many tech companies. This strategy is sometimes called “gamification,” and it’s meant to make apps “sticky” so you’ll keep using them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, parallel to the tech community, a number of researchers are working on behavioral health interventions. For instance, there’s Mitesh Patel, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who’s trying to figure out how to get Americans to be more active, whether or not they lose weight. One way to do this is with money. The most successful intervention he’s found involved promising people a certain amount of money if they are perfectly active, and deducting some of their winnings if they don’t make their goals. Stephen Intille, an associate professor at Northeastern University who studies health technology, has run studies on sensor systems that connect to mobile phones to track movement. One of the studies he’s co-authored is specifically about how people’s intention to exercise connects with whether they do, in fact, work out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there aren’t a lot of fitness trackers infused with legitimate behavioral science, says Patel. While plenty of apps use gamification strategies, those strategies tend to be ill-conceived, based on standard economics and the idea that people are rational. “They think about all the different possibilities, and ‘How much will this cake or this gym workout add to my overall life,’ and then make a decision,” Patel says. “But we know people don’t do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apple Watch is a behavioral intervention device that was created without consulting any behaviorists. I asked Apple directly about this — both at the original presentation around the Watch and again just before publication. I was told that Apple doesn’t use outside consultants, though it does invite researchers to come discuss their work, including those who have interests in habit formation and behavior change. Apple didn’t formally hire any behaviorists to design the Watch, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lack of depth in behavioral research shows in the Watch’s reward design. It’s not just that the Watch doesn’t take into account the recent stuff — the old stuff Skinner produced isn’t reflected, either — but Apple hasn’t participated in the kinds of verification studies that might give someone confidence in their approach to fitness. As long as Apple isn’t making a specific health claim, it doesn’t have to verify its device is accurate with the FDA. Only a few studies exist on fitness trackers’ accuracy, Patel says, which makes it challenging for both patients and doctors to trust a smartwatch’s data. And the rewards aren’t set up in the ways we know are most effective. The Watch is ultimately a weak tool. It might be effective for some people, but there’s a lot of behavioral research out there that suggests it could be much more effective for many more people.
    </p>
    <p>
      TheThe first week I put it on, the Apple Watch says I have to make 300 calories’ worth of movement in order to achieve my goals. So I do. This isn’t hard, and a couple days later, I actually triple my goal, which feels good. I know this because the Watch tells me. It feels good to get the little gold star and the silly badge that confirms I’ve made my stand goal, my activity goal, and my exercise goal for the week. The next Monday, the Watch tells me I should shoot for 750 calories.
      <br>This is when the failure begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constraint on the Move goal is my rest days. I don’t do yoga on Tuesdays or Thursdays. Instead, I cook, usually in big enough portions that I can use the leftovers for lunch the next day. The relevant thing here is that cooking takes time; I can’t work out and cook at the same time. Without rest days, I hardly cook at all, which means I spend more money on takeout, which is generally worse for me than the foods I prepare myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apple Watch doesn’t care about any of this. Rest days are the limiting factor on my ability to hit my Move goal — while I easily hit 700 calories by the Watch’s measure on my workout days, I move a lot less when I take time off from working out. But rest days are crucial for exercise: they let your body recover. Without recovery, you don’t get the strength you’re trying to build, and you place yourself at risk for overuse injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Move goal is adjustable — I can lower it at any time — but there’s no way to program the Watch to consistently honor my rest days. I just have to manually lower the goal for that day, and then raise it for the next one. Unfortunately, this requires too much of my attention. I have actual things to do that are more important than manually telling my fitness app to let me rest, so mostly I forget to do it until it’s too late. Even when I remember, I wind up with a different problem: I forget to reset the Watch to a higher Move goal the next day. I spent one week being psyched that I hit my goal only to discover that I had only hit the lowered goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that 750-calorie goal, which seemed quite high, proved insurmountable the first week. I am especially resentful about not making my Move goal the second week when I went backpacking (not through any fault of my own, but because the Apple Watch’s paltry battery life and delicate nature didn’t seem like a good idea for the trail). It’s designed for indoor kids, I told my editor. I didn’t make the 750-calorie goal the week after that, either. Or the week after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere around the first month, I began to think of the Apple Watch as my failure bracelet.
      <br>The nickname stuck even when I lowered my Move goal to 500 calories, which felt like admitting defeat. I failed at the 500-calorie goal, too — the rest day problem again — but I got a lot closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After four months with it, I’m tired of being punished. It’s no wonder people don’t wear fitness trackers for very long — Apple’s device isn’t the only one with this problem — but because I’m supposed to be wearing the fitness tracker for this article, I don’t take it off. I just figure out how to cheat. Which I do, flagrantly, for another month until I become disgusted with myself and send the Watch back to Apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not especially compelled by the Apple Watch. I am almost certainly part of the 20 to 42 percent of people who would stop using it within the first six months. I know other people like it; I’ve even met actual monsters who told me how much they loved the Breathe function. It doesn’t surprise me much that there’s a great deal of variation in how we all approach health and technology. There are all kinds of people. A rich tapestry, etc. But if behavioral interventions are to succeed in the long term, they shouldn’t make users feel anxious and unhappy. That’s the thing we’ve always known about exercise: you need to find something you enjoy doing and be rewarded for it.
      <br><br><br>Otherwise, it doesn’t matter how good the algorithm is — you’ll stay on the couch.
